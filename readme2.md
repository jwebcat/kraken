# Kraken-Sass

This is a SCSS fork of Kraken it is very similar to the original with the added power of SASS.

Kraken is a lightweight, mobile-first boilerplate for front-end web developers. It includes just the essentials:

* A CSS reset to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
* A responsive, mobile-first grid.
* A well-designed, fluid typographic scale.
* CSS3 buttons.
* Basic form styling.
* Optional add-ons for more functionality.

- Extras for kraken-sass

* Mixins for the grid and more (have a look)
* A Settings file where you can easily adjust any project variable
*
